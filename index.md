### Back ground

My friend (Cloud) touch jekyll and recommend that to me. I like the simple way like this to write blogs, so I decide to make one to document down the tech stuff and my life.  Thanks to my wife be with me at the coffee shop to create this.

Hello World, here we are.

### Some reference

### code highlight support

After reading several documents, finally find out a way to support code block highlight which I think would be very useful.

{% highlight c %}
/* hello world demo */
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
