## Overview of Java 8


Java 8 include several important update which make programer's life much more easier. in include

* Lambda expressions 
* Default methods 
* Aggregate operations 
* Date-Time APIs
* Type annotations 

And other area says **Security**, **Permission**, **JDBC** stuff, but we will not cover them here. Please read to [official doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) to get more detail.

### Download

1. download [jdk 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 

2. To have a good start, I recommend you to download the java 8 [tutorial](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html). There are a couple of code example under the java folder

3. For IDE, strongly recommend [InteliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), version 13.1 can support java 8

### Reference


* [Java 8 Features â€“ The ULTIMATE Guide](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/05/java-8-features-tutorial.html)

* I create a study project on [github](https://github.com/jaylu/java8study) , it 
	* has maven set up for compiling with java 1.8. 
	* some of the examples from jdk
	* some of the examples from the reference doc above


## Content

### Lambda expression

[official doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)

* From previous java version, we can achieve that by passing a **Command Object** to achieve passing 'how to do' to a function. 

* The Lambda can simplify it, but it some kind break the strong type restriction in the java. Previously we have to define a command object, but for now we don't. It require us have a better understanding on Lambda expression otherwise the code will drop into a situation which very hard to maintain. 

* [Method references](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html) make the Lambda expressions more readable.

* remember below @FunctionalInterface when declaring your Lambda API would be good
	
	* Predicate<T> : boolean test(T t); Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
	
	* Supplier<T> : T get(); Represents a supplier of results.
	
	* Consumer<T> : void accept(T t); Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
	
	* BiConsumer<T, U> : void accept(T t, U u);Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.

	* Function<T, R>: R apply(T t); Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
	
	* BiFunction<T, U, R> : R apply(T t, U u); Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
	
	* UnaryOperator<T> : extends Function<T, T>; Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
	


### Default methods

[official doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html)

* Keyword: **interface default static**

* Default method is quite straight forward, it's about defining the default implementation in the interface.

* One of the good example usage for that is the extend the existing interface with default method. Comparator is a good example, it add reversed(), thenComparing() method with the **default** keyword, moreover, you may have interest to have a look how it use the **static** keyword (says 1. provide shortcut to Collections, 2. accept FunctionInterface as parameter). 

### Aggregate Operations

[official doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/index.html)

* Below example can tell about for the new collection usage. 

	{% highlight java %}
	double average = roster    
    .stream()    
    .filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)    
    .mapToInt(Person::getAge)    
    .average()    
    .getAsDouble();  
    {% endhighlight %}  

  
    
* [map reduce support](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/reduction.html)

* [Parallelism](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/parallelism.html) and [Fork/Join](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html)


### Date Time API

* Clock
	
	Best practice for applications is to pass a Clock into any method that requires the current instant. A dependency injection framework is one way to achieve this. This approach allows an alternate clock, such as **fixed** or **offset** to be used during testing.
	
	{% highlight java %}
    public class MyBean {
      private Clock clock;  // dependency inject
      ...
      public void process(LocalDate eventDate) {
        if (eventDate.isBefore(LocalDate.now(clock)) {
          ...
        }
      }
    }
	{% endhighlight %}  



	
	
* LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime

* Duration

### Type Annotations

* repeating annotation
